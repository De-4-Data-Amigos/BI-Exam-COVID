# Idea for a problem statement:
In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare systems worldwide have been under unprecedented stress due to the dynamic and rapid spread of the virus. There is a critical need to optimize resource allocation, improve patient outcomes, and enhance the efficiency of public health responses. Our COVID-19 dataset contains detailed information on virus spread, healthcare system strain, and population demographics. We aim to leverage Business Intelligence (BI) tools to analyze this data to try and identify patterns, predict healthcare needs, and support decision-making processes and thus lessen the burden on society.

# Motivation
Early on we thought about covid19 for a project, as it's a topic that has affected us all for years. It was however not easy to come by data that we could use, which halted us for a bit. Then we went back and forth with a problem statement, before landing on above.

# Theoretical foundation
Our research is based on analyzing our dataset, on the background of all of us experienced a pandemic. All four of us has had covid19 and know people dying from it, and we think it's a very interesting matter to pursue.

# Argument of choices 
We have to admit that we were strapped for time at the end. We spent ALOT of time trying to clean data from different sources before we ended up on our chosen one.
Out of this and our problem statement, we came up with three hypothesis', which we then refined and found models fitting to help answer these.
